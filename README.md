## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
 
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hand-Gesture-Recognition-using-ML.git
   cd Hand-Gesture-Recognition-using-ML


2. Create a virtual environment:

   Using pip:

 
   pip install -r requirements_pip.txt
  

   Or using conda:

  =
   conda create --name gesture_env --file requirements_conda.txt
   conda activate gesture_env

## üß† Model Training

1. Collect gesture images:

 
   python collect-data.py
   

2. Preprocess and clean images:

  
   python preprocessing.py
  

3. Train the model:

  
   python train.py

## üì∑ Run the Application

Once the model is trained, you can start the live recognition:

```bash
python app.py
```
